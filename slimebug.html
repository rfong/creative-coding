    <h1>procedural slime bugs</h1>
    <p>(the bugs don't know about bounding boxes, so you'll have to refresh when they wander off the canvas 😂)</p>
    <p>Interesting / funny observations about this sketch:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To simplify the math, the bugs are drawn within a translated relative frame of reference. However, the slime trails need to be drawn in absolute coordinates.</li>
      <li>A legitimate use case for "absolute butt coordinates"</li>
      <li>The slime trails are attenuated without factoring in a time variable by using a stack of slime sizes that is decremented proportionally to the slime trail index.</li>
    </ul>
