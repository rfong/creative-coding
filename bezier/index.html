    <h1>Bezier curves</h1>
    <p>Bezier curves (or "B-curves") are often used in computer graphics & design to define smooth, flowing shapes.</p>

    <p>Have you ever wondered why digital fonts can be resized to arbitrarily large sizes and they still look good and smooth?</p>
    <p>Digital fonts aren't images. They don't have resolution issues because they are defined using Bezier curves. As the font changes size, the shapes you see are re-interpolated based on the position of the points defining the Bezier curves. So you have secretly seen thousands of very tiny Bezier curves every time you look at a web browser.</p>

    <p>A Bezier curve is a <b>polynomial curve</b>. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Linear Bezier curves (order <code>x</code>) are just straight lines.</li>
      <li>Quadratic Bezier curves (order <code>x^2</code>) are parabolas.</li>
      <li>Cubic Bezier curves (order <code>x^3</code>) are more useful for vector art, so these are the kind you've probably seen the most.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, the user defines them in terms of "anchor points" and "control points" rather than as a polynomial equation <code>d*x^3 + c*x^2 + b*x + a</code>.
