    <p>prompt: Standing silently in the quiet snowfall</p>
    <p>Not exactly on prompt, but I've always wanted a 2d particle simulator. It's basically cellular automata with materials with various behaviors & physics. Draw on the canvas below to start.</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>I just wanted to play around with the cellular automata aspect, so I cribbed the canvas, UI, event management code, and sand behavior from <a href="https://jason.today/falling-sand">jason.today's excellent writeup</a> on making a falling sand pixel simulator.</p>
    <p>what I added:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>refactored the original code down to be much simpler/smaller</li>
      <li>simple water simulation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>bugs to fix:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>water level should equalize between two tubes; need to simulate pressure</li>
      <li>fix water jitter with the top row modulus remainder's worth of pixels</li>
      <li>things can currently "fall" through an empty diagonal in an otherwise contiguous barrier</li>
    </ul>
