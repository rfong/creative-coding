    <h1>ghost lines</h1>

  	<p>Today's prompts: use lines wisely (I used them unwisely), self-portrait, look deep into the void. What I did:</p>
  	<ul>
  	  <li>sampled a webcam stream in greyscale</li>
  	  <li>found the frame's center of "mass" (where black=hi, white=lo)</li>
  	  <li>randomly sampled a subset of the points that changed values between sample frames by over a nontrivial threshold</li>
  	  <li>drew vectors of the change in overall frame center of mass from those points</li>
  	</ul>
  	<p>Draft is shamefully nonperformant, and this method of choosing lines doesn't always line up with intuition, but I had fun.</p>
