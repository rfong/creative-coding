# langmap WIP

### What's this?

Idea: you can click on IPA glyphs and the map shows you where those phonemes are commonly spoken in the world

### Task breakdown
- [x] get the shader to change color at a specified ASCII "pixel"
- [ ] change color at a collection of specified ASCII "pixels"
- [ ] some hardcoded IPA glyphs to use as controls

- [ ] actual clickable IPA chart
- [ ] geolocation data for the languages in phoible
- [ ] lat/lng mapping to coordinates on the map representation
